Website Structure
1. Home Page (Leo's Travels):
I made the first page all about Leo's travels, with cool pictures and a map showing where he's been.
2. Travel Tips:
I added a section full of helpful travel tips for students, like what to pack, staying safe, and understanding local customs.
3. Personal Stories:
Leo got to share his favorite travel stories in a blog-style format. I added pictures and even let readers leave comments.
4. Checklist Generator (with JavaScript magic):
I made a super helpful checklist tool. You can choose your destination and why you're going, and it automatically generates a checklist for you.
