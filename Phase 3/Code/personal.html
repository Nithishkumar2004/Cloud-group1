                <h2>Mongolia - Aisa</h2>
                <p>Mongolia, situated in East and Central Asia, is a landlocked country known for its vast and rugged landscapes. Its capital and largest city, Ulaanbaatar, is nestled in the north-central region. As of my last update in September 2021, Mongolia's population was approximately 3.3 million, making it one of the world's least densely populated nations.

                    The official language is Mongolian, and Mongolia operates as a parliamentary republic with a democratic political system. The country has a president as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of government.
                    
                    Mongolia boasts a rich and storied history, deeply rooted in nomadic culture. One of its most famous historical figures is Genghis Khan, who founded the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. This empire was among the largest land empires in history, stretching across vast territories in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
                    
                    Traditionally, Mongolia's economy revolved around agriculture, particularly livestock herding. However, in recent years, mining has gained prominence, with extensive mineral reserves, including coal, copper, and gold. This shift has driven economic growth but has also presented challenges regarding sustainable resource management.
                    
                    Mongolia's culture is a tapestry of traditional art, music, and dance. The nomadic lifestyle is a defining aspect, influencing everything from clothing to housing. The "deel," the traditional clothing, and the nomadic yurt, known as a "ger," are symbolic of this rich culture.
